# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The data for the project can be located at "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI HAR Dataset.zip"

The dataset that is being used for this project is Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and can be located at "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"

In addition to this README.md file, this repository contains the following three files:

1. "run_analysis.R": This is the R script for performing the analysis. This R script needs to be launched within the RStudio, and should be run from the main working directory where the uncompressed/unaltered Samsung data is also available.

2. "CodeBook.md": This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data.

3. "sensor_averages_by_subject_activity.txt": This is final independent output tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
